            <ul>
                <li>Each page uses external css and at least has 2 css styles linked back to it. The <span>default.css</span> is located in root folder and applies the styling for the heading, navigation, footer, and back to the top to all pages except the about page. other css files is named after their html file. for example <span>about.css</span> corresponds to the about page</li>
                <li>Each page uses 2 links to external css files. One links to the <span>default.css</span> and the other <span>[page name].css</span></li>
                <li>There is a div/container for each major part of the pages. For example the welcome block of the home page is seperated into their own div</li>
                <li>Each div is given a class or an id and is styled accordingly</li>

                        <li>
                            in general, const was used for DOM selector variables. These variables are variables i dont want to change its value of hence i use const to make sure the values dont get updated/mutated.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            i used <span>let</span> in favor of <span>var</span> to make sure that the variable's scope did not overlap with other variables within the same block.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            for example, when there are multiple nested loops. i could use for(let i=0) for the outer loops but also for(let i=0) for the inner loop without any errors.

                            <span>apply.js (line 75)</span> - <span>data.set()</span> was used to push an array of the applied major to <span>data</span> when an user click the 'rank of choice' button.

This is because when a user click the 'rank of choice' button, the <span>data</span> map may have key that is out of order. For the map to be properly implemented in the html table, i needed to order the keys in ascending order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>apply.js (line 112,114,117)</span> - some map methods like <span>Array.from(data.keys())</span> was used here for creating and checking gaps in the table.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            overall, i used map to record the applied majors in the apply page and then put them inside the html table according to the correct order of keys.
